Summary: Highlights from the July, 2019 meetup.

## Presentation on Open Source Software for Fun and for Profit

An updated version can be found at [here](https://bkmgit.gitlab.io/presentations/prestashop)

Comments on payment integration options in Prestashop and that open source projects can serve as a way to get more people 
involved in tech. 

## General discussion

Somewhat better recording is needed. [OBS studio](https://obsproject.com/) is one option. A number of others are listed at 
[Itsfoss](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-screen-recorders/).

Need to encourage sponsors in addition to [Ona](https://ona.io/). Translation helpful, but need to find
high impact projects and encourage reuse of existing open source software where it fits real needs.

## Meeting sponsors

* [Ona](https://ona.io/) - Helping you do amazing things with data
